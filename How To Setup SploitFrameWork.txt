To   Setup   Sploit   You   Must   First   Follow   These   Steps




1. Downlaod Python 3 - > https://www.python.org/

2. Then Open Command Prompt And Type "cd" Then The Path that SploitFramework.py Is In (For Example If The SploitFramework.py File Is In Desktop Type "cd Desktop")

3. Once The Path Is Set Type "SploitFramework.py" And There You Go . . .



If   FrameWork   Does   Not   Load   These   Are   The   Posssible   Problems



1. Open Command Prompt And Type "pip install colorama" It Will Install The Color Module

2. Make Sure You Have Installed Python 3 Not 2 - > https://www.python.org/

3. Make Sure You Have Set The Correct Path, I Would Recommend Putting SploitFrameWork.py On Desktop And Typing "cd Desktop" In Command Prompt For Setting The Path
